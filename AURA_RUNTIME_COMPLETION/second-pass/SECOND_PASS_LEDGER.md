# AURA Second-Pass Ledger

**Status:** append-only execution ledger for the one-gap-at-a-time prompt
chain. The canonical historical ledgers remain
`AURA_RUNTIME_COMPLETION/state/PROGRAM_LEDGER.md` and
`ledger/PROJECT_LEDGER.md`; this file is their focused second-pass projection.

## Synchronization contract

Every entry must contain prompt ID, gap IDs, predecessor evidence, objective,
authority, exact work, cognitive resolution record, evidence IDs, residual
risks, acceptance verdict, and next prompt. A missing field blocks transition.
Corrections are appended, never rewritten.

### 2026-08-09T12:26:40Z — SECOND_PASS_CHAIN_DESIGNED — pending execution

- **Actor:** Codex engineering session; documentation/state authority only.
- **Source:** Full prompt 0–15 audit `EV-OPEN-GAPS-20260809-FULL-AUDIT-01`.
- **Delivered:** Control contract, Tier-0/Tier-1 context read order, prompt
  contract, sequential manifest/state design, and one focused prompt per
  remaining gap cluster.
- **Current state:** `SP-000` is `pending`; no second-pass prompt is marked
  complete; first-pass R2–R12/FINAL gates remain authoritative and open.
- **Authority:** No source feature, TCC, install, provider/account, telemetry,
  beta, signing, release, deploy, commit, push, or merge authority.
- **Next action:** Validate the chain, then start `SP-000` only after the user
  explicitly authorizes second-pass execution.

### 2026-08-09T12:56:26Z — SECOND_PASS_CONTROL_PLANE_VALIDATED — SP-000 pending

- **Prompt ID:** Control-plane validation; no `SP-*` prompt was executed.
- **Gap IDs:** `OPEN-00`–`OPEN-15` are mapped by the manifest; none is closed by this record.
- **Predecessor evidence:** `EV-OPEN-GAPS-20260809-FULL-AUDIT-01`.
- **Objective:** Make the open-gap register, anti-amnesia context, linear prompt manifest, machine state, focused ledger, and session handoff mutually checkable.
- **Authority:** Documentation/state/test authority only. No app launch/install, TCC, provider/account, telemetry/beta, signing, release/deploy, commit, push, or merge authority.
- **Exact work:** Corrected the generated prompt filenames/front matter, enforced a strict 34-step predecessor chain, added the stdlib validator and 3 tests, linked the control files, and synchronized `ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`, `session-handoff.json`, `current-state.json`, evidence, and risk projections.
- **Cognitive resolution record:** The observed control-plane defect was projection drift risk and malformed generated prompt metadata. The mechanism was generation-time escaping/filename contamination; the direct fix normalized the files and added executable cross-file invariants. Falsification would be any validator-detected missing/duplicate/misaligned prompt, state skip, gap omission, or handoff/context disagreement. This resolves the control-plane artifact only; it does not resolve any product gap.
- **Evidence:** `EV-SECOND-PASS-20260809-CONTROL-PLANE-01` — static/contract class; validator and 26/26 deterministic script tests passed.
- **Residual risks:** `RISK-SECOND-PASS-SYNC-DRIFT` remains `Mitigating`; every future prompt attempt must append its own cognitive/evidence record and rerun the validator. R2–R12/FINAL live and release gates remain open or blocked.
- **Acceptance verdict:** The second-pass chain is structurally valid; `SP-000` remains `pending` and no prompt may advance.
- **Next prompt/action:** `SP-000`; begin only after explicit user authorization and Tier-0/Tier-1 read order validation.

### 2026-08-09T12:59:35Z — SECOND_PASS_PROMPT_MARKDOWN_NORMALIZED — SP-000 pending

- **Prompt ID:** Control-plane correction; no `SP-*` prompt was executed.
- **Gap IDs:** `OPEN-00`–`OPEN-15`; none is closed by this record.
- **Predecessor evidence:** `EV-SECOND-PASS-20260809-CONTROL-PLANE-01`.
- **Objective:** Remove malformed inline-code markers from the generated Tier-1 read lists without changing prompt scope or transition order.
- **Authority:** Documentation/state/test authority only; all consequential runtime, account, permission, beta, release, and delivery actions remain unauthorized.
- **Exact work:** Normalized all 34 prompt files and rescanned filenames, literal escapes, and unclosed inline-code lines.
- **Cognitive resolution record:** The defect was a generation-time escape artifact that could make context references ambiguous even though the chain validator passed. The correction is falsified by any remaining malformed marker or validator/test failure; both scans and validations passed.
- **Evidence:** `EV-SECOND-PASS-20260809-CONTROL-PLANE-02` — static/contract class.
- **Residual risks:** `RISK-SECOND-PASS-SYNC-DRIFT` remains `Mitigating`; every prompt attempt still requires its own evidence and closeout.
- **Acceptance verdict:** Prompt Markdown is normalized; `SP-000` remains `pending`.
- **Next prompt/action:** `SP-000`; do not start `SP-001` without SP-000 completion evidence and validator pass.

### 2026-08-12T15:20:00Z — SECOND_PASS_CONTEXT_SURFACE_ARCHIVED — SP-000 pending

- **Prompt ID:** Control-plane maintenance; no `SP-*` prompt was executed.
- **Gap IDs:** None closed; `OPEN-00`–`OPEN-15` remain unchanged.
- **Predecessor evidence:** `EV-SECOND-PASS-20260809-CONTROL-PLANE-02`.
- **Objective:** Reduce default context noise by separating completed first-pass prompt/context prose from the active second-pass surface without deleting evidence or changing prompt order.
- **Authority:** Documentation/state/test authority only. No product source, TCC, install, provider/account, telemetry, beta, signing, release, deploy, commit, push, or merge authority.
- **Exact work:** Archived first-pass prompt definitions 00–13 and legacy startup/context prose; updated the first-pass manifest/schema, second-pass read contract, context index, open-gap links, runtime pointer README, archive index, handoff, risk projection, and append-only ledgers. ADR/subsystem `docs/` remain canonical on-demand Tier-1 references.
- **Cognitive resolution record:** The exact gap was excessive default-visible first-pass material after the repository's remaining work had moved to the second-pass chain. The mechanism was historical prompt/context files remaining in active directories despite the Tier-0/Tier-1 contract. The fix is falsified by any missing manifest target, broken required reference, validator failure, or accidental SP/state transition; all final checks passed. Confidence: high for control-plane routing, not a product-gate claim.
- **Evidence:** `EV-SECOND-PASS-CONTEXT-ARCHIVE-20260812-01` — static/contract class; all four validators, 38/38 deterministic tests, JSON, shell, and diff checks passed.
- **Residual risks:** `RISK-REPO-HYGIENE-CONTEXT-BLOAT` remains `Mitigating` because append-only ledgers and named ADR/subsystem references remain available; repository maintainer owns future Tier-1 pointer refresh. `RISK-SECOND-PASS-SYNC-DRIFT` remains `Mitigating`.
- **Acceptance verdict:** Archive and routing are complete for this maintenance scope; `SP-000` remains `pending`, no prompt was completed, and no gap was closed.
- **Next prompt/action:** On explicit authorization, read the second-pass Tier-0 contract and execute only `SP-000`; do not open `SP-001` automatically.

### 2026-08-12T15:45:00Z — SECOND_PASS_REPO_SURFACE_CLEANUP — SP-000 pending

- **Prompt ID:** Control-plane cleanup; no `SP-*` prompt was executed.
- **Gap IDs:** None closed; `OPEN-00`–`OPEN-15` remain unchanged.
- **Objective:** Remove empty structural directories and one unreferenced legacy guide that add visual noise without deleting active evidence or canonical controls.
- **Authority:** Documentation/state cleanup only. No product source, dependency/tool install, permission, Git-object, prompt transition, commit, push, merge, release, or deployment authority.
- **Exact work:** Removed the empty `AURA_RUNTIME_COMPLETION/prompts/repo_hygiene`, `anti_amnesia`, and root `schemas` directories; moved `AURA_RUNTIME_COMPLETION/state/README.md` to the dated first-pass archive. Preserved generated build/cache surfaces and all canonical second-pass/hygiene/ADR/ledger/schema files.
- **Cognitive resolution record:** The observed gap was empty legacy directories and an unreferenced directory guide remaining after first-pass migration. The mechanism was filesystem directories surviving after tracked contents moved. Falsification is any non-empty target, active reference, validator failure, or missing required schema/control file; final scans and validators must remain green.
- **Evidence:** `EV-SECOND-PASS-REPO-SURFACE-CLEANUP-20260812-01` — static/contract class.
- **Residual risks:** Generated ignored caches and `.DS_Store` files remain intentionally outside this cleanup boundary; context-bloat and second-pass synchronization risks remain mitigated, not closed.
- **Acceptance verdict:** Structural cleanup complete for the proven safe targets; `SP-000` remains `pending` and no gap was closed.
- **Next prompt/action:** On explicit authorization, read the second-pass Tier-0 contract and execute only `SP-000`.
